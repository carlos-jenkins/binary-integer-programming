Linear programming (LP, or linear optimization) is a mathematical method for
determining a way to achieve the best outcome (such as maximum profit or
lowest cost) in a given mathematical model for some list of requirements
represented as linear relationships.

If some or all of the unknown variables are required to be integers, then the
problem is called an integer programming (IP) or integer linear programming
(ILP) problem.  0-1 integer programming or binary integer programming (BIP) is
the special case of integer programming where variables are required to be 0 or
1 (rather than arbitrary integers).
